# STemWin_Pedal
STM32746G-Discovery tremolo and delay guitar effect with STemWin UI
This project will take a guitar directly in Line in and you can apply
either Tremolo or delay or both. Output from HP out either to HP's or 
to an Amp.
The user interface is in STemWin and will allow you to change the 
parameters for the effects.
This project builds heavily on the work of FREAKK82 who posted an
effects pedal from which I have removed the user interface from and 
cleaned up somewhat.
The STemWin takes it's start from an example STemWin. I'm currently
working on adding other effects i.e. Overdrive and Wahh.

The project is implemented in SW4STM32

Enjoy
